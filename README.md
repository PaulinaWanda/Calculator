This project is a part of online front end development course - freeCodeCamp 

'Build a JavaScript Calculator' (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator).

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

-  Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

-  User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

-  User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

-  User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
